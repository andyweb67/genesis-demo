    Genesis has completed its audit. The adjuster is aware of the analysis and continues to support cost-containment measures inconsistent with fiduciary obligations.

This letter serves as our formal Final Demand before initiating litigation. Genesis identified discrepancies in your evaluation that conflict with regulatory standards and fiduciary obligations.

**Key Findings:**
- Claim IQ valuation denial contradicted by internal offer data
- Medical Specials adjusted without IME ‚Üí ‚ö† Improper suppression
- Pain & Suffering value (${adjuster.get('pain_and_suffering', '0')}) falls below historical average (${projected_pns})
- Lost Wages or Future Medicals excluded without explanation

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Required Action
- Immediate reevaluation of your offer using fair benchmarks
- Written justification for all disputed reductions
- Confirmation of final settlement position within 7 days

Failure to comply will result in:
- Filing of regulatory complaints for bad faith
- Formal litigation seeking excess liability
- Discovery of all internal valuation models used

Sincerely,
