> Genesis doesn't plead for value. It forces recognition of it.

At every step, the insurer faces a choice:
- **Acknowledge value** and resolve fairly
- **Suppress value** and face escalating risk

Genesis exposes what traditional demand letters can't:
- Omitted severity inputs
- Claim IQ suppression patterns
- Adjuster script deviations

# Slide 4: Chain Reaction (The Poker Table)
st.header("Step 4: The Chain Reaction")

st.markdown("""
Imagine the claim process as a poker game:

- **Lowball Bet** â†’ $19,000 offer
- **Genesis Raises** â†’ Audit exposes suppression
- **Insurer Calls or Folds** â†’ Offer increasesâ€¦ or litigation begins

Here's how Genesis builds that pressure:

1. **Audit Module** â€“ Genesis performs a forensic scan of the demand package, extracting dollar values, ICD-10 injury codes, and high-severity claims. It identifies what the insurer has omitted, downgraded, or ignored.

2. **Adjuster Interrogation** â€“ A structured sequence of questions forces the adjuster to confirm or deny key facts: liability, IME status, software usage. Their responses are recorded and evaluated for consistency and fairness.

3. **ZAP Response Engine** â€“ When an adjuster disputes a value without proper justification, Genesis instantly fires back a targeted rebuttal â€” grounded in medical facts, legal precedent, or jurisdictional data. These are called ZAPs.

4. **Reconciliation Review Table (RRT)** â€“ This table compares the attorney's demand values with the insurerâ€™s responses. Every conflict is highlighted. Every unjustified reduction becomes a documented point of exposure.

5. **Final Demand + Prophet Simulation** â€“ If the insurer refuses to move, Genesis issues a final demand and runs a jury-facing simulation. This is where the insurer sees what happens when suppression is exposed in court.

# Slide 5: What Happens If They Refuse?
st.header("Step 5: What Happens If They Refuse?")
st.markdown("""
If the insurer wonâ€™t move:
- Genesis pressures disclosure of Claim IQ ranges
- Extracts ALOG adjuster notes
- Compares historical settlement data
- Simulates jury impact using Prophet

> A jury doesnâ€™t just see a claim â€” they see **suppression.**

Thatâ€™s when the insurer realizes: they gambledâ€¦ and lost.

# Slide 6: How Genesis Works (Without Exposing the IP)
st.markdown("---")
st.header("How Genesis Works â€” Without Showing You the Engine")

st.markdown("""
Genesis is built for one thing: **results**.

It doesnâ€™t require you to configure logic trees, weight multipliers, or navigate complex claim strategy.

It doesnâ€™t teach you suppression tactics â€” it **neutralizes** them.

You donâ€™t need to see the mechanics behind Genesis. In fact, you canâ€™t.
Thatâ€™s intentional.

> **The real leverage is protected in Genesis logic â€” not disclosed to the user.**

You see the outcome:
- Increased offer
- Documented suppression
- Escalation readiness

> *We donâ€™t expose the engine. We expose the suppression.*
